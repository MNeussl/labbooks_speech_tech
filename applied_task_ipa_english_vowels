\section{Lab Book A1.}
In A1 we focus on differences between phonemes and orthographic letters. 

\begin{problem}{1}
\textbf{[2]} \textit{Same sound}: Come up with a set of 4 English words that have the CVC structure, where C = consonant, V = vowel. CVCC, CCVC and CCVCC words are also allowed. Vowel sound should always be the same. For example, “hoot”, “grew”, “moon“, “suit” all have the same vowel \textipa{/u/}. Name the vowel in IPA.
\end{problem}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{solution}
Four words with the same vowel:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item seat
    \item mach\textbf{i}ne 
    \item see
    \item key
\end{enumerate}


\end{solution}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}{2}
\textbf{[4]} \textit{Counting sounds}: Give three examples of the English words where there are more sounds than letters and three examples of the English words where there are less sounds than letters.
E.g., in word ``axis'' there are 5 sounds, and in the word ``knock'' there 3 sounds.  Do not use the same examples of the letter-sound combinations, think of different ones (e.g., do not provide three words with letter 'x' that makes the two sounds /ks/). 
\end{problem}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{solution}
Three words where there are more sounds than letters:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item by
    \item USA
    \item Museum
\end{enumerate}
\bigskip

Three words where there are less sounds than letters:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item air
    \item school
    \item thought
\end{enumerate}

\end{solution}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}{3}
\textbf{[4]} \textit{Be creative}: A famous example of irregularities in English spelling and pronunciation is word “ghoti”, first mention of which dates back to 1855 (in the correspondence between Charles Ollier and Leigh Hunt).

The word is intended to be pronounced in the same way as ``fish'' (\textipa{/fIS/}) using these sounds:
\begin{itemize}
    \item gh, pronounced as \textipa{/f/} as in enough \textipa{/I"n2f/}
    \item o, pronounced as \textipa{/I/} as in women \textipa{/"wImIn/}
    \item ti, pronounced as \textipa{/S/} as in nation \textipa{/"neIS9n/} or motion \textipa{/"moUS9n/}
\end{itemize}


One would expect to pronounce the word in English as "goatee", \textipa{/"goUti/}, not "fish".

You can follow the “ghoti” example above and come up with a creative or absurd spelling of any existing word that would demonstrate English or other language idiosyncrasies. Here are the steps:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Select a real English word or words you will work with.
	\item Find alternative spelling for all sounds in that word or words -- these alternative spelling should be backed up by other existing words.
	\item Provide transcriptions for the words from which you have taken specific sounds.
	\item Provide the transctiption of how you expect people to read your resulted spelling.
\end{itemize}


\end{problem}

\begin{solution}

\underline{Your word(s)}: Frequency, coin

\bigskip

\underline{Creative or absurd spelling of your word(s)}: Phlachimse, Tshwom
\bigskip

\underline{Transcriptions for the words from which you have taken specific sounds}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item < f > from \textbf{Ph}onetics
    \item < r >from co\textbf{l}onel
    \item < e > from c\textbf{a}t
    \item < qu > from \textbf{ch}oir
    \item < e > from g\textbf{i}rl
    \item < n > from autu\textbf{m}n
    \item < c > from \textbf{s}ide < c > =[s], the phone is the same
    \item < y > from rout\textbf{i}ne

    \item < c > from Cappu\textbf{c}cino [\textipa{k{\ae}pUtS"i:noU}]
    \item < o > from \textbf{o}ne [wan] 
    \item < i> from w\textbf{o}men [\textipa{wImIn}]
    \item < n > from autu\textbf{m}n
    


\end{itemize}

\underline{The pronunciation of your creative spelling}: what you would expect people to pronounce your made up spelling?
\bigskip


[\textipa{fl{\ae}SI\textipa{mz}}], [\textipa{tSwom}]
